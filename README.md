# Hey, I'm Glen 👋

I spent the last 8 years taking a Silicon Valley startup from seed stage to acquisition
($20M+ ARR), building developer tooling and infrastructure across AWS, hundreds of edge servers, air-gapped on-premise deployments, and much for the the company which serves thousands of connected mobile devices globally to deliver a real device testing platform with AI analytics for Fortune 500 companies.  I've built distributed test runners, orchestrated the runners, and secured the untrusted code being ran in containers for isolation.  I've also built custom distributed build and deployment servers, monitoring dashboards, and a small mobile app for health checks.

## Expertise

- **Static Analysis & Developer Tooling** - Fast, actionable code quality analysis
- **AI Workflow Orchestration** - Reproducible, parallel AI-assisted development
- **Systems Programming** - Performance-critical applications in Rust
- **Infrastructure at Scale** - CI/CD and IaC for distributed systems

## Featured Projects

### [Debtmap](https://github.com/iepathos/debtmap)
Answers "what should I refactor first?" using entropy-based complexity analysis.
10-100x faster than alternatives with 70% fewer false positives.
`Rust • Rayon • Multi-language AST analysis`

### [Prodigy](https://github.com/iepathos/prodigy)
Transforms ad-hoc AI coding sessions into reproducible development pipelines
with parallel execution and automatic recovery.
`Rust • Claude AI • Git integration`

## Currently

- 🔨 Shipping: Debtmap with expanded language support
- 💡 Exploring: How to make static analysis results more actionable
- 📖 Writing: About code complexity metrics

## Let's Connect

I'm open to interesting opportunities and collaborations, especially in:
- Early-stage startups building infrastructure or developer tools
