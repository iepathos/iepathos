# Hey, I'm Glen üëã

**Staff Software Engineer | 13 years building systems that scale**

I've built many diverse projects in my 13+ year career. I spent the last 8 years taking a Silicon Valley startup from early stage to acquisition, team building, mentoring younger engineers, and building better developer tooling. I wrote and maintained deployment code for infrastructure across AWS, hundreds of edge servers, air-gapped on-premise deployments. I designed and built distributed test runners with isolated container environments for running untrusted customer code. I also built custom distributed build and deployment servers, monitoring dashboards, Unity games - one of which is published on Steam and one of which won in the 2021 Houdini Game Jam, and so much more.

## What I Build

**Developer Tools That Ship**
- [Debtmap](https://github.com/iepathos/debtmap) - Entropy-based code complexity analysis. 10-100x faster than alternatives, 70% fewer false positives. Answers "what should I refactor first?" with actual data.
- [Prodigy](https://github.com/iepathos/prodigy) - Transforms chaotic AI coding sessions into reproducible pipelines with parallel execution and automatic recovery. Because AI agents fail, a lot.  This brings infrastructure as code discipline to AI coding agent orchestration.

**Infrastructure at Scale**
- Built distributed test runners for untrusted code execution (containerized isolation)
- Designed CI/CD systems handling hundreds of edge servers + air-gapped deployments
- Created monitoring and deployment infrastructure that survived an acquisition

**Core Skills**: Rust ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ AWS ‚Ä¢ Distributed Systems ‚Ä¢ Team Building ‚Ä¢ Technical Leadership

## Currently

- üöÄ Shipping multi-language support for Debtmap
- üî¨ Researching: Can we make linters opinionated enough to actually reduce complexity?
- ‚úçÔ∏è Writing about why most code complexity metrics lie to you

## What I'm Looking For

I'm open to **Staff/Senior Staff** roles where:
- Technical depth matters (systems, infrastructure, developer tools)
- Building 0‚Üí1 is more common than maintaining legacy
- I can mentor engineers and influence architecture
- Bonus: Early-stage startups, deep tech, or technical co-founder opportunities

Not interested in: FAANG-style leetcode grinds, or roles where "staff" means "senior engineer who's been here a while"

*I'm particularly interested in companies working on developer productivity,
infrastructure tooling, or practical AI applications. If you're building
something that makes engineers' lives measurably better, I want to hear about it.*
