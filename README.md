# Hey, I'm Glen 👋

**Staff Software Engineer | 13 years building systems that scale**

I'm a polyglot comfortable across the stack. I've built many diverse projects in my 13+ year career. I spent the last 8 years taking a Silicon Valley startup from early stage to acquisition, team building, mentoring younger engineers, and building better developer tooling. I wrote and maintained deployment code for infrastructure across AWS, hundreds of edge servers, and air-gapped on-premise deployments. I designed and coded distributed test runners with isolated container environments for running untrusted customer code. I also built custom distributed build and deployment servers, monitoring dashboards, Unity games - one of which is published on Steam and one of which won in the 2021 Houdini Game Jam, and so much more.

## What I Build

**Developer Tools That Ship**
- [Debtmap](https://github.com/iepathos/debtmap) - Multi-signal code analyzer that predicts bug hotspots by combining cognitive complexity, pattern recognition, coverage gaps, and git history. Uses information-theory entropy analysis, data flow, and pattern detection (pure mappings, framework patterns, state machines) to reduce false positives. Answers "what should I test or refactor first?" with quantified impact metrics and actionable recommendations.
- [Prodigy](https://github.com/iepathos/prodigy) - Transforms chaotic AI coding sessions into reproducible pipelines with parallel execution and automatic recovery. Because AI agents fail, a lot.  This brings infrastructure as code discipline to AI coding agent orchestration.

**Infrastructure at Scale**
- Built distributed test runners for untrusted code execution (containerized isolation)
- Designed CI/CD systems handling hundreds of edge servers + air-gapped deployments
- Created monitoring and deployment infrastructure that survived an acquisition

**Core Skills**: Rust • Python • AWS • Distributed Systems • Team Building • Technical Leadership

## Currently

- 🚀 Shipping analysis and UX improvements for Debtmap
- 🔬 Researching: Can we make linters opinionated enough to actually reduce complexity?
- ✍️ Writing about code analysis, Rust, and functional programming patterns

## What I'm Looking For

I'm open to **Staff/Senior Staff** roles where:
- Technical depth matters (systems, infrastructure, developer tools)
- Building 0→1 is more common than maintaining legacy
- I can mentor engineers and influence architecture
- Bonus: Early-stage startups, deep tech, or technical co-founder opportunities

*I'm particularly interested in companies working on developer productivity,
infrastructure tooling, or practical AI applications. If you're building
something that makes engineers' lives measurably better, I want to hear about it.*
