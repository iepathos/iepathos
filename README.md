# Hey, I'm Glen ðŸ‘‹

I spent the last 8 years taking a Silicon Valley startup from seed stage to acquisition
($20M+ ARR), building developer and operations tooling and global infrastructure across AWS, hundreds of edge servers, air-gapped on-premise deployments, and thousands of
connected mobile devices for Fortune 500 clients.

## Expertise

- **Static Analysis & Developer Tooling** - Fast, actionable code quality analysis
- **AI Workflow Orchestration** - Reproducible, parallel AI-assisted development
- **Systems Programming** - Performance-critical applications in Rust
- **Infrastructure at Scale** - CI/CD and IaC for distributed systems

## Featured Projects

### [Debtmap](https://github.com/iepathos/debtmap)
Answers "what should I refactor first?" using entropy-based complexity analysis.
10-100x faster than alternatives with 70% fewer false positives.
`Rust â€¢ Rayon â€¢ Multi-language AST analysis`

### [Prodigy](https://github.com/iepathos/prodigy)
Transforms ad-hoc AI coding sessions into reproducible development pipelines
with parallel execution and automatic recovery.
`Rust â€¢ Claude AI â€¢ Git integration`

## Currently

- ðŸ”¨ Shipping: Debtmap with expanded language support
